# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization
This repository consists of the codes as part of Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization course in Coursera, and other solutions to the problems of DSA in Geeks for Geeks (This repo is created during my preparation of DSA, so few codes might be the exact same solution available in that website).
